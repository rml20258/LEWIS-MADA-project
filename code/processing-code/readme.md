# processing-code

All data processing is performed in "processing-code.qmd". 
Raw data are pulled from the "data/raw-data" folder, processed via the qmd file, and clean data are stored in the "data/processed-data" folder.
Each processed dataset was cleaned and combined to create "project_data" which is used for all analyses.
