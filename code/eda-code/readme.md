# eda-code

This folder contains code to do all exploratory data analyses (EDA) on the complete cases from the "project_data" file in the 
  "data/processed-data" folder.
The code produces a few tables and figures. Files that will be used in the manuscript are saved in which are saved in the 
  appropriate `results` sub-folder and can be created with "eda_for_manuscript.qmd". Other figures/tables were produced for 
  exploratory purposes and have not been saved, but they can be recreated using the EDA coding file "eda.qmd"
