# analysis-code

The 'statistical-analysis.R' file contains code needed to perform all analyses included in the 
the Modeling section of the Results in the Manuscript and the Supplementary Material. Results from the
Descriptive Analyses section of the Results are performed using the `eda_for_manuscript.qmd` file. 
All results are stored as images in order to knit the Word document and can be referred to in the Manuscript.qmd
file without running statistical-analysis.R.
