The 'statistical-analysis.R' file contains code needed to perform all analyses included in the 
"Basic statistical analysis" section of the Results in the Manuscript. All results are stored
as images in order to knit the Word document and can be refered to in the Manuscript.qmd
file without running statistical-analysis.R.
